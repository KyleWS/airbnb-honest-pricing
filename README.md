# Context
Airbnb is increasingly hiding the prices of their options because the market supply they pull from is increasingly full of grifters trying to make a living on the housing market while degrading the vibrance of their cities, and while AirBNB continues to degrade the trust its US users used to have in it.

Our savior comes surprisingly from the AU gov't, as Australia passed a law (cannot find this law anywhere) that means when viewed they must show the total cost of the product being offered. The minor inconvenience is converting this value to AUD. This extension automates that.

# Steps
- Clone this directory
- Go to chrome://extensions/  (Cannot be linked to, must type it)
- In top right, select "Load unpacked"
- Navigate to the _directory_ and select (not a specific file within, the whole directory)
- Open extension menu and pin.
- Visit airbnb.com.au, whenever viewing the map view - press this button to convert read outs to USD
- NOTE: Conversion rate is hardcoded, change to current value first
